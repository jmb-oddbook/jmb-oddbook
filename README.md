## Hi there 👋 I'm Jessica, thanks for stopping by

I am a Data Analyst and aspiring Pythonista with a strong background in research.<br />
My love for data began while studying ancient Near Eastern Languages and Archaeology. Did you know, the number of cuneiform tablets lying in museums are in the 6-digit range and that a large part of these have not be edited yet? Just think of all that data lying there unread, unused, unloved :broken_heart:<br />
Studying ancient cultures was like a treasure hunt, not only with finding the material you needed but also formulating questions and figuring out different ways to approach them. Original research allowed me to tell stories from a perspective different to our own, acknowledging bias in the record, and connecting text and data in ways that were no obvious before.

I was drawn to Data Analytics and Data Science by their incredible diverse application possibilities as well as the opportunity to apply my research skills to projects where it could have a positive impact. This is a field with so much potential to do good socially, ecologically, and economically, the possibilities are endless.

As an analyst I enjoy working on innovative projects that have an ecological or sustainability focus and that would increase the livability of urban centres. I believe in ensuring that data is open, accessible, and understandable to citizens.
